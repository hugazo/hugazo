Hi! 👋🏽

My name is Hugo, and this is my Github profile.

If you read this maybe you are someone checking out my repositories or trying to learning something, in that case, i'm ver grateful that you took at least one minute.

😌 THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! 😌

I'm a chilean developer, and here you will mostly find some weird demoes, some base projects and maybe some implementations of several technologies.

🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱

My core is primarly JavaScript and TypeScript, with a lot of extras.

```javascript
console.log('Welcome and thank you!!');
