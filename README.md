Hi! 👋🏽

My name is Hugo, and this is my Github profile.

If you read this maybe you are someone checking out my repositories or trying to learning something, in that case, i'm very grateful that you took at least one minute to read this random profile on the internet.

😌 THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! 😌

Currently i work as a Lead Developer and Team Leader of a FrontEnd Team.

My Stack is Mainly VueJS for FrontEnd, Node for the Backend and some Pipeline to build my projects, i do like cloud services better, but i do know my containers 🐳 well.

I'm a chilean developer, and here you will mostly find some weird demoes, some base projects and maybe some implementations of several technologies.

```javascript
console.log('Welcome and thank you!!');
